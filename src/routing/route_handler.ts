/**
 * Abstract base class implementing a wiring convention on top of `Hono` (verified
 * against a real spike — Hono 4.12.27). `app.route("/admin/books", new BooksHandler())`
 * works as-is (Hono itself documents "use it by subclassing" as an intended pattern,
 * the same pattern used by presets such as `hono/quick`).
 *
 * Wiring order is fixed: `layout()` → `middleware()` → `register()`. Middleware
 * returned by `middleware()` runs after the renderer from `layout()` is applied
 * (allowing subsequent middleware to be written assuming the renderer's `c.render`
 * is available).
 *
 * Intended usage: the app defines per-namespace intermediate base classes (e.g.
 * `AdminHandler` providing `layout()`/`middleware()`), and individual handlers (e.g.
 * `BooksHandler`) only need to write `register()`. `main.ts` then contains only the
 * mounting line (`app.route("/admin/books", new BooksHandler())`), structurally
 * preventing handler logic from leaking into `main.ts`.
 *
 * **Constraints confirmed by the spike (must be observed):**
 *
 * 1. **Reserved names**: names that Hono itself uses as instance fields/methods
 *    (`get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `options`, `patch`, `all`, `on`, `use`, `router`,
 *    `getPath`, `routes`, `fetch`, `request`, `route`, `basePath`, `mount`, `notFound`,
 *    `onError`, etc.) must not be used as subclass hook or field names. In particular,
 *    `routes` is held by Hono as its route registry field (`routes = []`), and at the
 *    time `super()` runs it shadows a subclass prototype method of the same name,
 *    causing `this.routes is not a function` (confirmed on a real run).
 * 2. **Hooks must be written as methods/getters (not class fields)**. Because wiring
 *    runs inside the base constructor, subclass field initialization (which happens
 *    after `super()`) is too late. Writing `layout = AdminLayout` as a class field
 *    results in `undefined` (confirmed on a real run). Write it as a method instead,
 *    e.g. `protected layout() { return AdminLayout; }`.
 * 3. The RPC type chain (the `hc` client) is lost with the class-based approach, but
 *    this does not matter for an SSR-only stack (Turbo/Stimulus).
